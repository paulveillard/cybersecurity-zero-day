## What is a Zero-Day Attack (Exploit)?

![zero-day](https://github.com/paulveillard/cybersecurity-zero-day/blob/main/img/zero-day-attack-1.jpg)

A [zero-day (also known as a 0-day)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)) is a computer-software vulnerability previously unknown to those who should be interested in its mitigation, like the vendor of the target software.
- Until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can exploit it to adversely affect programs, data, additional computers or a network.
- An exploit taking advantage of a zero-day is called a zero-day exploit, or zero-day attack.

Software vendors continuously search for overlooked vulnerabilities and upon discovering such, issue a code fix also known as ‘patch’. However, a zero-day vulnerability is a software weakness that is found by attackers before the vendor has discovered the flaw.
